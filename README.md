## Project Overview

In this Pet Listing Application, you can:

- **Search** for pets by type, location, and breed.
- **View** detailed info about each pet you’re interested in.
- **Manage** your list of favorite pets with simple add and remove options.
- **Navigate** through the app with a responsive and user-friendly navigation bar.

## Technologies Used

Here’s a quick rundown of the technologies I used:

- **React**: I used React because it’s perfect for building interactive UIs. It lets me create reusable components and handle the app’s state efficiently.

- **Redux Toolkit**: For managing state, Redux Toolkit is a game-changer. It makes handling global state and updates super easy and straightforward.

- **Tailwind CSS**: This utility-first CSS framework lets me build custom designs quickly and responsively. It’s a fantastic way to keep the styling consistent and modern.

- **Bootstrap**: I incorporated Bootstrap for some additional pre-designed components and styles to give the app a polished look.

- **Axios**: Axios is my go-to for making API requests. It simplifies handling requests and responses, making data fetching a breeze.

- **React Router DOM**: For smooth and dynamic routing, React Router DOM does the trick. It helps users navigate between different parts of the app seamlessly.

- **Vite**: I chose Vite for its incredibly fast development server and efficient build process. It makes developing and building the app a lot quicker and more enjoyable.

- **react-responsive-carousel**: This component helps display a slideshow of pet images, making the pet listings more engaging.

- **Framer Motion**: To add some flair, I used Framer Motion for smooth and customizable animations. It really enhances the user interaction experience.

## Setup and Installation

Getting this project up and running on your local machine is straightforward. Here’s how:

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/pet-listing-app.git
    ```

2. **Navigate into the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd pet-listing-app
    ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. **Start the development server with Vite:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    Your app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Project Structure

Here’s a brief overview of how the project is organized:

- **`/src`**: This folder contains all the source files for the app.
  - **`/components`**: Contains React components like `Navbar`, `PetList`, `PetDetails`, `FavoritesList`, and more.
  - **`/redux`**: Includes Redux slices and the store configuration.
  - **`App.jsx`**: The main component where routing is set up.
  - **`index.js`**: The entry point that renders the app.

## Design Decisions

Here’s a bit about the choices I made:

- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit was the obvious choice for managing state because it simplifies the process and keeps things organized.
  
- **Styling**: I combined Tailwind CSS and Bootstrap. Tailwind offers a lot of flexibility with styling, while Bootstrap provides some ready-made components.

- **Routing**: React Router DOM is used for routing to handle navigation smoothly.

- **Development Tools**: Vite’s fast build process and development server are a huge win for productivity. It made working on this project much more enjoyable.

## Usage

Here’s how you can use the app:

1. **Search for Pets**: Use the search bar in the navbar to filter pets by type, location, and breed.
